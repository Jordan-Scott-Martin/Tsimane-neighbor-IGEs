# Tsimane-neighbor-IGEs
R and Stan code for all analyses reported in Martin et al. (under review) _Indirect genetic effects among neighbors promote cooperation and accelerate adaptation in a small-scale human society_. The ```tsi data preparation.R``` file details how our raw database files were transformed into a Stan data list, which was subsequently used to conduct all statistical analyses contained in ```tsi data analysis.R```. The accompanying ```.stan``` files detail how our models were structured for analysis (see the R file for further details). To protect the rights of participants in our study, accompanying data files for these analyses cannot be made openly available without formal application and approval (please see the _data and materials availability_ statement in the accompanying manuscript).
